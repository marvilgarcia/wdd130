      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Most young people my age in the Dominican Republic would have liked to have learned to play a musical instrument, but we could not because due to a lack of resources and money.

        I have created GarlimMusic. It is a music school, where children, youth, and adults can not only learn to play instruments but also learn to build them and learn how to use music as a source of income. 
        
        I want my school to be accessible to people with low resources. And for that reason we have create a web page where we can Enrolled students, make payments, buy articles (music instruments), virtual room to receive asynchronous assignments for people with difficulties, and the information students would have to review when they are on home practicing.
       </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our goal is to reach all young people, adults or children that every time they hear a simple melody, their hearts are filled with emotions. We have classes for different types of instruments, if you still do not decide on one, we help you find your vocation and become a confidant of that instrument. We are creating a family of musicians who support each other, where you will feel a supportive and familiar environment. We are looking for you !! If you are one of those who love music and want to grow by learning a new instrument or perfecting your technique, that is you.
